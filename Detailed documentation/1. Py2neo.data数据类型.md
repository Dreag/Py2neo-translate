### 1. py2neo.data – Data Types

**注意**为了方便，py2neo.data可以直接从py2ne中导入。

Py2neo provides a rich set of data types for working with both graph and record-based data. The graph types are completely compatible with Neo4j but can also be used independently. They include the fundamental entities Node and Relationship as well as classes that represent collections of these entities.
**Py2neo**提供了丰富的数据类型，可以工作在graph和record-based数据中。graph类型完全兼容Neo4j，但也可以独立使用。它们包括基本实体Node和Relationship以及代表这些实体集合的类。

Graph data classes have been designed to work together using standard operations, most notably set operations. Details of these operations are covered in the sections on Subgraph objects and Path objects and other Walkable types.
