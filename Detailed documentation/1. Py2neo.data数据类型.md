### 1. py2neo.data – Data Types

**注意**为了方便，py2neo.data可以直接从py2ne中导入。

Py2neo provides a rich set of data types for working with both graph and record-based data. The graph types are completely compatible with Neo4j but can also be used independently. They include the fundamental entities Node and Relationship as well as classes that represent collections of these entities.

**Py2neo**提供了丰富的数据类型，可以工作在graph和record-based数据中。graph类型完全兼容Neo4j，但也可以独立使用。它们包括基本实体Node和Relationship以及代表这些实体集合的类。

Graph data classes have been designed to work together using standard operations, most notably set operations. Details of these operations are covered in the sections on Subgraph objects and Path objects and other Walkable types.

Graph数据类使用标准化设计方案，最明显的是set（集合）操作。这些操作的细节包含在Subgraph objects、 Path objects和other Walkable types这几个节内容当中。

# 1.1. 节点和节点关系

The two essential building blocks of the labelled property graph model used by Neo4j are the Node and the Relationship. The node is the fundamental unit of data storage within a graph. It can contain a set of key-value pairs (properties) and can optionally be adorned with one or more textual labels. A relationship is a typed, directed connection between a pair of nodes (or alternatively a loop on a single node). Like nodes, relationships may also contain a set of properties.

Neo4j使用的标签属性的图模型的两个基本构件是节点和边。节点是图存储数据的基本单位。它可以包含一组键值对（属性），并可以选择性地用一个或多个文本标签进行装饰。 关系是一对节点之间的类型化的定向连接（或者是单个节点上的循环）。 像节点一样，关系也可以包含一组属性。


The code below shows how to create a couple of nodes and a relationship joining them. Each node has a single property, name, and is labelled as a Person. The relationship ab describes a KNOWS connection from the first node a to the second node b.

下面的代码显示了如何创建一对节点以及连接它们的关系。 每个节点都有一个属性，名称，并被标记为一个人。 关系ab描述从节点a到节点b的一个KNOWS连接。

```python
>>> from py2neo.data import Node, Relationship
>>> a = Node("Person", name="Alice")
>>> b = Node("Person", name="Bob")
>>> ab = Relationship(a, "KNOWS", b)
>>> ab
(Alice)-[:KNOWS] -> (Bob)
```
class py2neo.data.Node(*labels, **properties)
  Construct a new node object with the labels and properties specified. In its initial state, a node is unbound. This means that it       exists only on the client and does not reference a corresponding server node. A node is typically bound by creating it in a Neo4j       database.
  结构化一个新带有标签和具体属性值的节点，在初始状态下，一个节点未被绑定，这意味着它只存在于客户端节点，不引用相应的
